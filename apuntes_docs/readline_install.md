==> Caveats
readline is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /Users/apardo-m/.brew,
because macOS provides BSD libedit.

For compilers to find readline you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/Users/apardo-m/.brew/opt/readline/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/apardo-m/.brew/opt/readline/include"
==> Summary
🍺  /Users/apardo-m/.brew/Cellar/readline/8.2.7: 50 files, 1.7MB, built in 19 seconds
